Let us say that you know there is a folder called something like home, but you do not know. Then just type
"cd h" and press the TAB key, and the Terminal will suggest /home/ to you. If you press tab twice it will give you
more suggestions (if there are more folders starting with "h")

This works with commands as well. Type the beginning of a command and then press TAB. Like for instance "dat" and then TAB.
Then the Terminal will suggest "date" as an autocomplete suggestion.
